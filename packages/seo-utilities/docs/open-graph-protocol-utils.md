## open-graph-protocol-utils package

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [assert(condition, message)](./open-graph-protocol-utils.assert.md) | Throw an error if the condition fails. Also known as <code>invariant</code>. |
|  [assert(condition, message)](./open-graph-protocol-utils.assert_1.md) | Asserts that the condition is of a specific type. Throw an error if the condition fails. Also known as <code>invariant</code>. |
|  [insertIf(condition, elements)](./open-graph-protocol-utils.insertif.md) | Returns the provided elements wrap in an array if the given condition turns to be truthy. It is meant as immutable alternative of the method push on the Array structure. The consumer should then unwrap the boxed elements by mean on spreading operation. Since the JS spread operator disregards the empty array, it won't modify the original structure in case of falsy condition. |
|  [insertLazilyIf(condition, lazyElement)](./open-graph-protocol-utils.insertlazilyif.md) | Returns the result of invoking the provided callback boxed in an immutable array if the given condition turns to be truthy. The condition itself is passed in as an argument to the lazy callback to be used at the discretion of the caller. It is meant as immutable alternative of the method push on the Array structure. The consumer should then unwrap the boxed elements by mean on spreading operation. Since the JS spread operator disregards the empty array, it won't modify the original structure in case of falsy condition. |
|  [isArray(arg)](./open-graph-protocol-utils.isarray.md) | Patch for Array.isArray <code>isArray(arg: any): arg is any[];</code> |
|  [isNotFalsy(value)](./open-graph-protocol-utils.isnotfalsy.md) | A not falsy type-guard. |
|  [isNotNullish(value)](./open-graph-protocol-utils.isnotnullish.md) | A not nullish type-guard, where nullish is either <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [maxLength](./open-graph-protocol-utils.maxlength.md) | A curry helper function that operates on string to trim them at a given length |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [NotFalsy](./open-graph-protocol-utils.notfalsy.md) | Removes from a given T all possible instance value JavaScript deems Falsy |
|  [ValueOf](./open-graph-protocol-utils.valueof.md) | A generic utility type that operates on ObjectType and will return codomain of all its values as a disjoint union. Optionally it accepts the union type some assignable keys to narrow down the codomain. |
