## 🌍 My Journey  

I’ve always been on a **search for meaning** — first through 📜history, then through 💻 code. As a student of Modern History, I tried to make sense of humanity by breaking it down into events, behaviors, and patterns. Now, as a 🔍🛠 software engineer, I do the same — just with systems, data, and the occasional stack trace.

Along the way, I met **Morena**, the ❤️ love of my life, and together we built something truly meaningful: 👨‍👩‍👦 **a family**. Parenthood shifted my perspective — suddenly, my choices weren’t just about me but about building a solid future for them.

In **2014**, I took a leap from studying the past to helping shape the future, switching careers to software engineering. It turns out, **breaking things apart to understand them** works just as well in tech as it does in history. And while the universe may be fundamentally meaningless, I’ve found purpose in craftsmanship and the joy of learning. And if I don’t always know the question, at least I can take comfort in knowing the answer — **42**.  

## My Professional Philosophy 🚀💻  

After more than a decade in the field, I’ve come to see software engineering as more than just a job—it’s a craft. 🛠️ I don’t just aim to write working software; I aim to write *well-crafted* software. This mindset is at the core of **Software Craftsmanship**, an idea championed by **Bob Martin** (Uncle Bob) and later formalized in the *Software Craftsmanship Manifesto* by **Sandro Mancuso** and others. ✍️ It builds upon Agile principles but pushes them further, focusing on **professionalism, responsibility, and continuous learning**. 📚⚡  

Along the way, I also discovered **Extreme Programming (XP)**, a set of technical practices introduced by **Kent Beck** in the late ’90s. XP emphasizes writing **simple, high-quality code** through **discipline, feedback, and iteration**. 🔄 These ideas deeply resonate with how I approach software development. 💡✨  

### 🛠️ Craft Over Code  
Software isn’t just about making things work—it’s about making things *right*. ✅ Good software isn’t brittle, hard to change, or overly complex. Instead, it’s **clean, testable, and evolves gracefully** over time. I take pride in refining my work, knowing that well-crafted code makes life easier for everyone who touches it.  

### 🎯 Simplicity is Strength  
I believe in **keeping things simple**—not simplistic, but simple in a way that reduces unnecessary complexity. 🤯 Practices like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** ✅ and **refactoring** 🧼—which **Kent Beck** and **Martin Fowler** strongly advocate for—aren’t just buzzwords; they help me write **clear, maintainable, and long-lasting** code. The less cluttered the code, the more space there is for solving real problems. 🧩💡  

### 💰 Adding Value Beyond Features  
A software engineer’s job isn’t just to add features or fix bugs—it’s to **steadily add value**. 🏗️ That means improving the structure of the codebase, making systems easier to change, and ensuring that the software remains flexible and maintainable over time. 🏛️ As the *Software Craftsmanship Manifesto* states, a **rewrite should be a last resort, not an inevitability**. ⚖️  

### 🤝 A Responsibility to the Craft  
Professionalism in software means **taking ownership**—not just of what I build but *how* I build it. 🏆 It means keeping up with new ideas, refining my skills, and being intentional about writing **quality software**. 🧠 It also means treating my employer or client as a **customer** 🤵, not just someone handing me a spec. My job is to provide **solutions, not just code**. This mindset is at the core of Software Craftsmanship, which emphasizes that we should be **not only well-functioning developers but also reliable partners** in building great software. 🎨🏗️  

### 🔄 A Never-Ending Learning Curve  
Software development is an **ever-changing field**, and that’s what makes it exciting. 🚀 I’m always looking for **better ways** to write code, structure applications, and think about software design. Whether it’s diving into **functional programming** 🧑‍💻, exploring **domain-driven design (DDD)** 🏛️, or improving my ability to communicate technical ideas, I see **learning as a core part of my work**. 🎓 As **Uncle Bob** puts it:
