## 🧑‍🦯‍➡️My Journey

I’ve always been on a **search for meaning** 🤌. At university, I chose to study **Modern History** because, at the time, it seemed like a great way to **ponder the grand mysteries of human civilization** while simultaneously ensuring I would never be burdened with excessive wealth.
It was as **intellectually fulfilling** as it was utterly useless in paying the bills.

That was fine — until I accidentally acquired **a wife and multiple children**.
Back then, being broke wasn’t a problem. As long as I could afford books, pasta, and the occasional coffee, life was good. But then I met **Morena**, the ❤️ love of my life, and somehow convinced her to keep me. Fast-forward a few years, and we had a **wonderful, chaotic, and highly demanding** family 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦. Suddenly, my choices weren’t just about **which obscure historical rabbit hole to fall into**, but also about **keeping small humans alive and financially supporting them in their relentless quest for snacks**.  
I needed a new career that was **as intellectually satisfying as history**, but with the added benefit of **not living exclusively on discount noodles**.

**Enter Software Engineering**.
Realizing I could get **paid** to tinker with complex systems and break things for a living felt like **finding a loophole in the Matrix**. Instead of being a historian documenting **the fall of empires**, I could now **cause server crashes in real-time**. Jackpot 🎰💸.
Turns out, **breaking things apart to understand them** works just as well in tech as it does in history — except now, instead of uncovering the past, I get to **accidentally deploy bugs into the future**.

And while the universe may be **fundamentally meaningless**, my search for meaning hasn’t been in vain. I’ve found purpose in **craftsmanship**, **curiosity**, and the **joy of learning**. And if I don’t always know "_the question_", at least I can take comfort in knowing "_the answer_" — **42** 🚀.



## 💻 My Professional Philosophy


After **more than a decade** in software development, and in my pursuit of refining my craft, I've explored countless methodologies and guidelines on what it means to be a “professional”. Eventually, I discovered the **Software Craftsmanship** movement, whose manifesto truly struck a chord. Over time, I've **embraced its principles as the foundation of my work**, finding them both practical and deeply aligned with the kind of developer I aspire to be.

After **more than a decade** in the field, I’ve come to see software engineering as more than just a job — it’s a craft. 🛠️ I don’t just aim to write working software; **I aim to write _well-crafted_ software**. This mindset is at the core of **Software Craftsmanship**, an idea championed by **Bob Martin** (Uncle Bob) and later formalized in the [*Software Craftsmanship Manifesto*](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) by **Sandro Mancuso** and others ✍️. It builds upon Agile principles but pushes them further, focusing on **professionalism, responsibility, and continuous learning** 📚⚡.

Along the way, I also discovered **Extreme Programming (XP)**, a set of technical practices introduced by **Kent Beck** in the late ’90s. XP emphasizes writing **simple, high-quality code** through **discipline, feedback, and iteration**. 🔄 These ideas deeply resonate with how I approach software development 💡✨.

### 🛠️ Craft Over Code

Software isn’t just about making things work — it’s about making things *right*. ✅ Good software isn’t brittle, hard to change, or overly complex. Instead, it’s **clean, testable, and evolves gracefully** over time. I take pride in refining my work, knowing that well-crafted code makes life easier for everyone who touches it.

### 🎯 Simplicity is Strength

I believe in **keeping things simple** — not simplistic, but straightforward enough to reduce unnecessary complexity 🤯. Practices like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** ✅ and **refactoring** 🧼 — which **Kent Beck** and **Martin Fowler** strongly advocate for — aren’t just buzzwords; they help me write **clear, maintainable, and long-lasting** code. The less cluttered the code, the more space there is for solving real problems 🧩💡.

### 💰 Adding Value Beyond Features

A software engineer’s job isn’t just to add features or fix bugs — it’s to **steadily add value** 🏗. That means improving the structure of the codebase, making systems easier to change, and ensuring that the software remains flexible and maintainable over time. 🏛️ As the *Software Craftsmanship Manifesto* states, a **rewrite should be a last resort, not an inevitability** ⚖️.

### 🤝 A Responsibility to the Craft

Professionalism in software means **taking ownership** — not just of what I build but *how* I build it. 🏆 It means keeping up with new ideas, refining my skills, and being intentional about writing **quality software**. 🧠 It also means treating my employer or client as a **customer** 🤵, not just someone handing me a spec. My job is to provide **solutions, not just code**. This mindset is at the core of Software Craftsmanship, which emphasizes that we should be **not only well-functioning developers but also reliable partners** in building great software 🎨🏗️.

### 🔄 A Never-Ending Learning Curve

Software development is an **ever-changing field**, and that’s what makes it exciting. 🚀 I’m always looking for **better ways** to write code, structure applications, and think about software design. Whether it’s diving into **functional programming** 🧑‍💻, exploring **domain-driven design (DDD)** 🏛️, or improving my ability to communicate technical ideas, I see **learning as a core part of my work** 🎓.

As **Uncle Bob** puts it: "_Professionalism in software means never stopping learning_" 📚.


I lived in 🇮🇹 Italy, 🇭🇷 Croatia, and 🇩🇪 Germany. Currently, **I'm located in Berlin, Germany**.
