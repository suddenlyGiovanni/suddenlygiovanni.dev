## 🌊 My Journey  

I grew up as a **curious kid** 🤓 in a small seaside town in north-east Italy, a place that taught me to appreciate **simplicity and beauty**. 🌅 Life, however, had its own plans for me. I initially pursued **Modern History** 📜 at university, fascinated by the past and the stories that shaped us. But somewhere along the way, I found myself on a very different path—one that had little to do with textbooks and everything to do with **solving problems and building things**. 💡  

During my time at university, I met **Morena** ❤️—the love of my life—and before I knew it, we were building a life together. Fast forward a few years, and I became a father to **three incredible kids**. 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Parenthood changed me in ways I couldn’t have imagined. It brought **clarity, purpose, and a deep drive** to create something meaningful.  

In **2014**, inspired by that newfound perspective, I made a deliberate **career pivot** 🛠️—from history to **software engineering**. This transition wasn’t just about picking up a new skill; it was about **embracing a new way of thinking**. Software quickly became my **medium for problem-solving**, a space where I could apply my curiosity, discipline, and creativity.  

And that’s how I landed here—writing code, refining my craft, and constantly learning. **It’s been an unconventional journey, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.** 🚀  

## My Professional Philosophy 🚀💻  

After more than a decade in the field, I’ve come to see software engineering as more than just a job—it’s a craft. 🛠️ I don’t just aim to write working software; I aim to write *well-crafted* software. This mindset is at the core of **Software Craftsmanship**, an idea championed by **Bob Martin** (Uncle Bob) and later formalized in the *Software Craftsmanship Manifesto* by **Sandro Mancuso** and others. ✍️ It builds upon Agile principles but pushes them further, focusing on **professionalism, responsibility, and continuous learning**. 📚⚡  

Along the way, I also discovered **Extreme Programming (XP)**, a set of technical practices introduced by **Kent Beck** in the late ’90s. XP emphasizes writing **simple, high-quality code** through **discipline, feedback, and iteration**. 🔄 These ideas deeply resonate with how I approach software development. 💡✨  

### 🛠️ Craft Over Code  
Software isn’t just about making things work—it’s about making things *right*. ✅ Good software isn’t brittle, hard to change, or overly complex. Instead, it’s **clean, testable, and evolves gracefully** over time. I take pride in refining my work, knowing that well-crafted code makes life easier for everyone who touches it.  

### 🎯 Simplicity is Strength  
I believe in **keeping things simple**—not simplistic, but simple in a way that reduces unnecessary complexity. 🤯 Practices like **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** ✅ and **refactoring** 🧼—which **Kent Beck** and **Martin Fowler** strongly advocate for—aren’t just buzzwords; they help me write **clear, maintainable, and long-lasting** code. The less cluttered the code, the more space there is for solving real problems. 🧩💡  

### 💰 Adding Value Beyond Features  
A software engineer’s job isn’t just to add features or fix bugs—it’s to **steadily add value**. 🏗️ That means improving the structure of the codebase, making systems easier to change, and ensuring that the software remains flexible and maintainable over time. 🏛️ As the *Software Craftsmanship Manifesto* states, a **rewrite should be a last resort, not an inevitability**. ⚖️  

### 🤝 A Responsibility to the Craft  
Professionalism in software means **taking ownership**—not just of what I build but *how* I build it. 🏆 It means keeping up with new ideas, refining my skills, and being intentional about writing **quality software**. 🧠 It also means treating my employer or client as a **customer** 🤵, not just someone handing me a spec. My job is to provide **solutions, not just code**. This mindset is at the core of Software Craftsmanship, which emphasizes that we should be **not only well-functioning developers but also reliable partners** in building great software. 🎨🏗️  

### 🔄 A Never-Ending Learning Curve  
Software development is an **ever-changing field**, and that’s what makes it exciting. 🚀 I’m always looking for **better ways** to write code, structure applications, and think about software design. Whether it’s diving into **functional programming** 🧑‍💻, exploring **domain-driven design (DDD)** 🏛️, or improving my ability to communicate technical ideas, I see **learning as a core part of my work**. 🎓 As **Uncle Bob** puts it:  

> *“Professionalism in software means never stopping learning.”* 🎯📚
