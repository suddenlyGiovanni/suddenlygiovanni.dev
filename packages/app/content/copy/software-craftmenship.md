Excerpt From "SOLID: The Software Design and Architecture Handbook" by Khalil Stemmler

# Software Craftsmanship (2006 — today)

There had been some talk about Software Craftsmanship before. The first book to hint that software development might be more of a trade than a science was “The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeymen to Master.” It drew comparisons between how developers learn and gain seniority to the apprenticeship model in medieval Europe, and was one of the first texts to attempt to distill some sense of professionalism toward software developers.
In 2006, Peter McBreen published the book Software Craftsmanship, solidifying the name and explaining many of today’s professional practices. Unfortunately for the craftsmanship community around this time, Agile had the limelight. We considered Agile to be the solution to our biggest problems, giving little need for this thing called Software Craftsmanship.
To nudge craftsmanship back into the spotlight, in 2008, Uncle Bob proposed a fifth value for the Agile Manifesto: “craftmanship over execution”.
Since things weren’t going the way we wanted them to with Agile, and because we deviated from technical Agile frameworks like XP, in 2009, a group of developers aimed to produce something to be written down that could concisely describe the craftsmanship movement. Eventually, we created the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto. The manifesto, printed below, took the Agile Manifesto’s values and pushed it further, promoting technical excellence and professionalism.

# The Software Craftsmanship Manifesto

The manifesto is as follows:
“As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value the following:

- Not only working software, but also well-crafted software
- Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value
- Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals
- Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships”

# Back to Basics (XP)

There’s still a lot of work to be done, but today, we’re seeing some positive changes in the
software industry around Agile and Software Craftsmanship.

**The software craftsmanship community is growing.**
Developers worldwide are organizing meetups, signing the original manifesto, and spreading the word of professionalism. This community may very well be the one that comes together to popularize and standardize the approach to solving that 60-year old productivity and quality problem.

Also, in 2019, a frustrated Uncle Bob published a book titled “Clean Agile: Back to Basics”, which is almost entirely
**a walkthrough of the technical practices of XP**.

If you ask me about my future assumptions, I would say that in the next decade or so, we’re going to see the craftsmanship and Agile communities converge. It’s only a matter of time before this happens because they share the same goal:
**to deliver high-quality software on time**.
I can see what it will take for us to have that full Agile transformation. We’ve seen now that we can’t leave out technical practices, and that we need to be more disciplined about sticking to those practices.

Now it’s up to us, the software craftspeople, to do our part and set an example.

# Craftsmanship: Professionalism in software development

## Definition

We’ll repeat the best definition for software craftsmanship.

Craftsmanship is professionalism in software development.

Software Craftsmanship is a professionalism **mindset**.
It’s not about if you have a certification, if you’re a senior developer, or if you practice TDD all the time.
It’s about taking **responsibility** for our careers, clients, and community. It also means taking *
*pride** in our solutions, working with **pragmatism
**, and seeking to constantly improve our reputations with the good work we do.

## Are you a software craftsperson?

If you do the things mentioned above, you’re already a software craftsperson. There’s no magic to it. Even if you don’t like the label and don’t want to call yourself a craftsman, that’s totally cool. What’s important is that you do these things.

## Understanding the manifesto

### Not only working software, but also well-crafted software

It’s important to remember that working software can also be software that’s:

- hard to change
- difficult to understand
- slow

But well-crafted software is software that is testable, flexible, and maintainable. It’s also software that gets better over time — growing in value as you put more time and care into it.

### Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value

Adding value isn’t just adding new features or fixing bugs. You can consider adding value to be continually improving the structure of the code, keeping it clean, testable, flexible, and maintainable. It costs a lot of money to perform re-writes, and though every application has a life-span, usually — if that’s the only feasible option on a relatively young application, it means we’ve failed.

### Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals

We’re not alone in this. Your fellow software developers are going through the same challenges you are. To push this industry forward, we need to share knowledge, learn from others, inspire, mentor and prepare the next generation of craftsmen.
Because software development is so young, and because there isn’t yet a standard for many things, knowledge sharing and mentorship are incredibly important. We don’t want to lose what we’ve discovered over the last 40 years. We want to keep quality high, and teaching less experienced developers how to work better is a form of leverage that will pay off in years to come. We all have this responsibility.

### Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships

We don’t believe in an employer-employee relationship. That doesn’t exist in software craftsmanship. Whatever is written on your contract is a formality. Instead, treat your employer as your customer, the same way you would if you were just a consultant or a contractor. Some important things to remember:

- Your employer isn’t responsible for ensuring you grow professionally — you are.
- Your employer isn’t responsible for ensuring you get a book budget, training, or sent to conferences and seminars — you are.
- Your responsibility is to treat your employer as a customer and provide them with excellent service (advice, consulting, development) and help them achieve their goals by performing high-value activities, even if that sometimes doesn’t mean coding. Sometimes it means giving a talk, a presentation, or writing a blog post.

Unfortunately, not all companies have a management structure that lets you work this way, and it can be hard to push back on what you believe is best for the business when the other party doesn’t see you as a partner.

# Craftsmanship principles

Staying true to the manifesto, we’re ready to discuss actionable things you can do to become a better software craftsperson today.

## To write well-crafted software…

**Care about what you do**.
The world relies on the work you and I do. There are at least 4-10 different computer systems (your earbuds, your phone, computer, appliances) in any given room. Put love and care into what you’re doing, because merely enjoying the work you do increases the likelihood of doing a good job.

**Use Agile technical best practices**.
There are some things that all professional software developers should know how to do, and when. TDD, refactoring, pair programming, and simple design are all essential technical Agile practices from XP. We learn how to master each of these in this book. Following that, we improve our design skills with design principles, patterns, and various architectural styles, etc. We’ll cover each of these throughout the book too.

**Always be improving yourself**.
There is always room for improvement. After reading this book, I encourage you to gradually work your way through the resources and readings I’ve listed in each chapter. Regularly learn new techniques, vendors, and exchange the tools in your toolbox for better ones.

**Know your industry**.
We discussed the brief history of software development, Agile, and the emergence of software craftsmanship. I’ll be the first to admit that I had no idea what Agile was about, what the original goals were, and what it meant for us to be Agile at work. It’s important to know why we do what we do. Keep an eye on emerging trends and updates to the libraries, frameworks, and languages you use to develop software.

**Learn the domain**.
Your job is to understand the problem space (what your client wants to accomplish) and create the solution space (software). If you know your client’s business, you’ll better understand the requirements; this enables you to ask better questions, understand likely ways that the code may or may not need to change, and contribute to discussions with domain experts. When you know the domain, the code becomes a metaphor for what happens in real life. In Domain-Driven Design, we call this the Ubiquitous Language, to use the same words from real-life in the business, in the code. If Agile is about making incremental improvements and short feedback loops, we can keep the code simple and avoid excessive designs by projecting what happens in real life to the code.

**Ruthless simplicity**.
Build precisely what is needed to get the feature to work. No more. Get a feel for when you’re diverging from that, adding more code or unnecessary abstractions, and catch yourself. If you practice TDD, The more code you have to account for, the more ways it can go wrong, and the more tests you need to write to ensure it behaves the way it should. Remember YAGNI — You Aren’t Gonna Need It.

**Practice**.
If you don’t use it, you lose it. You need to keep your skills sharp.

## To steadily add value…

**Apply the Boy Scout’s Rule**.
The Boy Scout’s rule is to leave the campground cleaner than when we found it. If you come across some confusing, messy, wrong code or code with unused variables, take some time to refactor it right away. It sets an excellent example for others, fostering the idea that this codebase is a place of cleanliness and quality. Hopefully, others will clue into that and give it the respect it deserves too. Some call this the “Broken Window Theory”.

**Refactor, guarded by tests**.
If you’re going to refactor something to be cleaner, you should first safeguard it with tests. We simply cannot safely change code without the presence of tests. Another good time to add tests and refactor is when we come across a bug. To fix bugs, write the test that proves the bug’s existence, then refactor the code so that the test passes, and the bug no longer exists. Over time, you’ll harden your app and sleep well knowing that you can change code with an increasing amount of safety.

**Be brave**.
Coming from the previous two statements, when you see code you’re scared to change because you’re scared it might break, and you’re scared of what might happen to you if you break it, this is the start of software rot. Everyone else is also scared. Be the brave one. Be brave to surround it with tests and refactor it into something understandable. Tests are your saving grace and will enable you to act like a professional.

**Learn and apply XP**.
It’s the most extensive, well-thought-out Agile way to deliver a software project. Learn it and challenge bureaucracy and non-technical management to apply its technical practices in your day-to-day work. It’s the professional thing to do. See “Help them see the value of technical practices” below to learn how to pitch it.

**Delight customers, helping them achieve whatever they want**.
Their goal is to make money, save money, and preserve revenue streams. Your goal is to help them do precisely that, by taking their fuzzy requirements, applying Agile best practices (XP), and turning it into the right thing.

## Engage in the community…

**Learn from others**.
There’s only so much you can learn on your own. Read developer blogs, books, watch courses, YouTube videos, and ask questions. Do pair programming. Some developers fear pair programming because the other developer might see them make a mistake. The best advice is to overcome this fear. Exposing yourself to how another person thinks and works can help you either refine or reconstruct the way you work.

**Mentor less experienced developers**.
Unfortunately, we don’t have more software apprenticeships. When you graduate from college, university, or boot camp, you’re an apprentice. You have little experience delivering quality software on time. You may have spent time learning a front-end JavaScript library or framework, but the professional practices (TDD, BDD, DDD, etc) are missing. Craftsmen take a note from other trades like plumbing and carve out time to nurture newcomers into the professional way of delivering software products. At Amazon, junior software developers’ PRs are subject to many scrutinies, but more experienced engineers leave incredibly helpful comments and feedback (sometimes 100+ comments on a PR). Eventually, junior developers get to the point where their PRs require a lot less feedback, and their code gets merged in 1 or 2 revisions rather than 10.

**Share what you know**.
Teaching is learning. I’ve learned more than I thought possible by sharing what I currently knew on the internet. If you’re wrong, someone will eventually correct you. This is important as an industry because we need to preserve what we’ve learned over time so that others can avoid the same mistakes. Therefore, write blog posts, code, share your wins, failures, ideas, tips — these help developers at different stages in their journey.

**Socialize with others**.
I was amazed I could ask for Vaughn Vernon’s advice on Twitter and actually get it. I was also surprised I could run polls, asking for what developers think “clean code” means, and receive an influx of opinions to inform my own better. Twitter can be a bit of a strange place sometimes, but as a developer, there’s a lot of value in being on the platform. You can network with others by engaging with their content and ideas, and having technical discussions. Offline, check out meetups and meet other developers using tools, technologies and approaches you’re interested in.

## Consider yourself a partner…

**Take responsibility for your own learning**.
Your employer is not responsible for your education. Imagine your doctor saying, “yes, I can help cure you, but I’m going to need you to pay for me to read these books as well.” Again, this is a reminder that the work we do is a trade, and it’s up to you to carve out time to improve.

**Take responsibility for success/failures**.
It sucks when things go wrong, but it’s noble to take responsibility and take action to fix situations. Taking responsibility for your shortcomings is an excellent way to preserve your relationships and reputation. You will screw up. Trust me. And reputation matters, so that you can land better work and opportunities. Look at it this way, when things go right, you can take the praise for that as well, and that feels good.

**Help them see the value of technical practices**.
How do you get your boss to see the value in TDD or refactoring? Don’t promote the technical practices; promote the value instead. People won’t change their minds unless they can see the value. So then, what’s the value of TDD? Well, you could tell your boss, who is incredibly aggressive in trying to get you to finish the project in as little time as possible, that TDD reduces the time it takes to test the system, results in fewer bugs, which means fewer hours coding. And that means they save money. You could also tell them that we could even release software a lot more reliably. They might ask, “what’s the cost of this?”. And that’s a good question to ask because everything comes with a cost. TDD’s cost is that everyone needs to know how to do it, and that may not be the case. You could offer to learn it and devote an hour to teaching your team how to do something that will save them hundreds of hours fixing bugs.

**Don’t overwork yourself**.
Most people don’t do good work when rushed. Most people also don’t do good work when they’re tired. Personally, as soon as I start to feel brain fatigue, I step away from the computer and go for a walk, exercise, or call it a day. Why? Because I know that whatever code comes out of my hands next is more than likely going to be a liability rather than an asset. You’re only human. My tip? Get the most important work done whenever you feel most alert in the day. For me, that’s right in the morning. It might be different for you though.

**Provide value, even when it’s not coding.**
We expect developers in an Agile-era of software development to act a lot more like generalists. So aim to provide the most value possible, even if it doesn’t involve coding. For example, you might see an opportunity to improve a process, pitch that. Question requirements and make sure we’re building what we need. Spend time understanding the business and how it makes money. Help leaders prioritize the most critical work. Give them options. Hopefully, you can see how valuable these things are.
