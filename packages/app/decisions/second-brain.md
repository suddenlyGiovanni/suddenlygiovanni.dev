## Layer Contracts

### 1. GitHub Integration Layer
```ts
// Core interfaces for GitHub integration
interface GitHubRepository {
  owner: string;
  repo: string;
  branch: string;
  path: string; // Base path where notes are stored
}

interface GitHubService {
  // Get metadata for all files in a directory
  listFiles(path: string): Promise<GitHubFile[]>;
  
  // Get content of a specific file
  getFileContent(path: string): Promise<GitHubContent>;
  
  // Get metadata about the latest commit for a file

```
### 2. Content Repository Layer

```ts
// Data structures for notes and their metadata
interface Note {
  id: string; // Typically derived from filename
  title: string;
  content: string; // Raw markdown content
  path: string; // Path in the repository
  lastModified: Date;

  isPublic: boolean;
}

interface NoteMetadata {
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  date?: Date;
  publicationDate?: Date;
  draft?: boolean;
  [key: string]: any; // Other custom frontmatter properties
}

interface NoteRepository {
  // Get all public notes with optional filtering
  getPublicNotes(options?: {
    tag?: string;
    limit?: number;
    offset?: number;
  }): Promise<Note[]>;
  
  // Get a specific note by ID
  getNoteById(id: string): Promise<Note | null>;
  
  // Get notes that link to the specified note
  getBacklinks(noteId: string): Promise<{id: string, title: string}[]>;
  
  // Get all unique tags across public notes
  getAllTags(): Promise<{tag: string, count: number}[]>;
  
  // Refresh the repository from the source

interface CacheService {
  // Get a value from cache, fetching it if not present
  get<T>(key: string, fetchFn: () => Promise<T>, options?: CacheOptions): Promise<T>;
  
  // Set a value in the cache
  set<T>(key: string, value: T, options?: CacheOptions): Promise<void>;
  
  // Remove a value from the cache
  invalidate(key: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Clear all cache entries
  clear(): Promise<void>;

    title: string;
    description: string;
    path: string;
    lastModified: string; // ISO string
    tags: string[];
  }[];
  tags: {tag: string, count: number}[];
  pagination: {
    total: number;
    page: number;
    pageSize: number;
    totalPages: number;
  };
}

interface NoteLoaderData {
  note: {
    id: string;

    description: string;
    lastModified: string;
    tags: string[];
    path: string;
  }>;
  activeTags?: string[];
  onTagClick?: (tag: string) => void;
}

interface NoteProps {
  note: {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    content: string; // HTML content
    lastModified: string;
    metadata: Record<string, any>;
  };
  backlinks: Array<{id: string, title: string}>;
  relatedNotes: Array<{id: string, title: string}>;
}

interface NoteGraphProps {
  noteId: string;
  depth?: number;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
}

interface SearchBarProps {
  onSearch: (query: string) => void;
  placeholder?: string;
  initialValue?: string;
}
```

## Implementation Strategy
To start implementation, I recommend focusing on the contracts between adjacent layers and implementing them from the bottom up:
1. **First**: Implement the GitHub Integration Layer
    - Create a GitHubService implementation that can list files and fetch content
    - Test it with actual GitHub repositories to ensure API compatibility

2. **Second**: Implement the Content Repository Layer
    - Create a NoteRepository that uses the GitHubService
    - Implement parsing of notes and frontmatter

3. **Third**: Implement the Content Processing Layer
    - Create a MarkdownProcessor that handles conversion and link processing
    - Test with sample Obsidian notes to ensure compatibility

4. **Fourth**: Implement the Cache Management Layer
    - Create a CacheService to reduce GitHub API calls
    - Integrate with the NoteRepository

5. **Fifth**: Implement the Data Access Layer
    - Create Remix loaders that use the NoteRepository
    - Handle URL parameters and query normalization

6. **Finally**: Implement the Presentation Layer
    - Create React components for displaying notes and lists
    - Implement navigation and search UI

## Initial Focus Areas
For your very first steps, focus on:
1. Setting up the GitHub API integration
2. Defining the note detection mechanism (how to identify public notes)
3. Implementing basic markdown parsing
4. Creating a simple cache to avoid API rate limits
5. Building a minimal UI to display a single note

This approach will get you a working end-to-end system quickly, which you can then iterate on to add more features.
