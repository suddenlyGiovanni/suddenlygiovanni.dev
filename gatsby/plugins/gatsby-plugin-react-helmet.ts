 * # Factory function to correctly configure `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`
 *
 * Provides drop-in support for server rendering data added with React Helmet.
 * React Helmet is a component which lets you control your document head using their React component.
 * With this plugin, attributes you add in their component, e.g. title, meta attributes, etc. will get added to the static HTML pages Gatsby builds.
 * This is important not just for site viewers, but also for SEO â€” title and description metadata stored in the document head is a key component used by Google in determining placement in search results.
 *
 * @see https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/?=gatsby-plugin-react-helmet
