# Hi! I'm Giovanni 👋

![profile picture of Giovanni Ravalico](../../content/assets/giovanni_ravalico-profile_color.jpg)

I am a self-taught **software developer**, a geek, and more generally a problem solver. I am also a young father of two and a committed husband.

I was born in 1986 ☢️ 💨 (you to do the math) and grew up in a small city by the sea 🌊 in the north-east of Italy 🇮🇹.

At the university, I studied Modern History, but I never actually graduated. There I met the love of my life ❤️, Morena, with whom I have been together ever since.

Soon after college, we got married 💍 and started our own family 👩‍❤️‍👨. In 2014 our hearts became soo much bigger when Eena 👶🏻 come about. Four years later, Elai 👶🏻 managed to have the same effect on us.

Kids are the most amazing thing that had happened to my life. The change they brought with them was huge, and this experience had been incredibly cathartic for me!

Thanks to this new perspective, in **2014**, I decided to **switch career** and transition toward software engineering.
That is the beginning of my unconventional journey toward becoming a software developer.
For any further information, please refer to my <ReadLink to="/resume">résumé</ReadLink>.

Besides loving to code and study about programing, I enjoy working with my hands and crafting stuff.

I lived in Italy 🇮🇹, Croatia 🇭🇷 , and Germany 🇩🇪. Currently, I'm located in Berlin, Germany.
